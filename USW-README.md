# **StretchGPT**

**Enhances the web ChatGPT experience for all viewports by expanding the usable chat area, making a few UI tweaks for improved readability, and enabling dynamic custom colorization for key elements - all while respecting the original ChatGPT aesthetic. Plays nice with other userstyles/browser extensions and all non-core features are toggleable.**

## **Core Functionality**
Expands the usable chat area by > 200% by replacing the default restrictive max-width and fixed margins/padding with much more subtle, adaptive spacing that scales according to your current viewport size.

## **Extra Toggleable Features:**

### **Custom Theme/Color Options**
- Pick from the 40+ included color presets to liven up the dull default color palette and make it easier to distinguish between your prompts and ChatGPT's responses.
- There are separate toggles in the userstyle's dropdown menu to apply the selected color to your messages and/or your message bubbles, as well as the prompt input elements.
### **Hide Sender Avatars**
- Remove the avatars from ChatGPT responses and free up more screen real estate (makes the most significant difference in mobile and tablet browsers).
### **Hide Disclaimer Text**
- Remove the warning text element at the bottom of the window ("ChatGPT can make mistakes. Check important info.") for a cleaner look, and to allow more space for the actual chat content.
