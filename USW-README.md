## **Additional Features/Options:**

### **Color customization**
- 40+ included color presets to liven up the bland default color palette.
- Individual toggles in the Userstyle options menu for applying the preset color to user message bubbles and prompt input/composer components.
- Apply the color to only the message bubble, or the bubble + the whole message container/row behind it.
- All color-related features disabled by default.
### **Expand chat bubbles**
- Allow the chat bubbles to expand and fill all of the available space (with a reasonable hard width limit set, so it doesn't become unusable on XXL screens).
### **Hide footer disclaimer**
- Remove the disclaimer text fixed to the bottom of the window (*"ChatGPT can make mistakes. Check important info."*), freeing up a bit more space for the actual chat content and giving a cleaner overall look.
